MapReduce is a popular distributed framework
for massive-scale parallel data analysis.
There are many existing implementation of MapReduce 
which adopt on the basic architecture and 
programming model of originally Google's MapReduce, 
such as Hadoop\cite{}, Dryad\cite{isard2007dryad}.


The Phoenix MapReduce libray\cite{ranger2007phoenix} 
is the most relevant work to \myds. 
Phoenix demostrate that MapReduce is a promising parallel programming
models in muliticore and multiprocess systems.
It creates a thread pool by Pthreads
and can schedule tasks dynamically to support itrative applications.
\myds differs from Phoenix mainly on that 
Phoenix need barrier between iterative MapReduce,
while \myds brokes barrier to speed up computing.
