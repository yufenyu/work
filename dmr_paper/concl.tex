\section{Conclusions And Furture Work}
\label{sec:concl}
Phoenix shows MapReduce model is a promising model and approach to use multicore resource for multicore and multiprocessor systmes.
However, it has limitations in terms of scalability and performance due to its manners of design and implementation.

In this paper, we analyzed scalability and performance limitations of Phoenix and provide practicable solution.
we provide a novel thread programming model for support scalable mapreduce, i.e., \myds. 
We have presented \myds, a scalable MapReduce model for multicore system.
%to support efficient iterative processing.
We significantly improved the scalability over Phoenix, achieving an average speedup improvement of 2.5x, and a peek speedup improvement of 10x.
Our evaluation further shows the scalability and reliablity of \myds for iterative processing.
As to poor performance on multicast across processors, our future work will provide scalable iterative processing.
