\section{Conclusions And Furture Work}
\label{sec:concl}
We have presented \myds,
a scalable iterative MapReduce model, 
to support efficient iterative processing.

Our evaluation further shows the scalability and reliablity of \myds
for iterative processing.
As to poor performance on multicast across processors,
our future work will provide NUMA-aware scalable iterative processing.
And supporting online-MapReduce.
