we identified a set of extensions to the 
programming model and improvements to its architecture
that will expand the applicability of MapReduce to more classes
of applications.

In this paper, we present the programming model
and the architecture of Twister an enhanced MapReduce
runtime that support iterative MapReduce computation efficiently.

we also show performance comparision of Twister with
other similar runtimes such as Hadoop and DryadLINQ 
for large scale data parallel applications.
