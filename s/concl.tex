\section{Conclusions And Furture Work}
\label{sec:concl}
Phoenix shows MapReduce model is a promising model and approach to use multicore resource for multicore and multiprocessor systmes.
However, it has limitations in terms of scalability and performance due to its manners of design and implementation.

In this paper, we analyzed scalability and performance limitations of Phoenix and provide practicable solution.
Then we provide a novel thread programming model (\myth) supporting scalable mapreduce, i.e., \myds. 
We have presented \myds, a scalable MapReduce model for multicore system.
%to support efficient iterative processing.
We significantly improved the scalability over Phoenix, achieving an average speedup improvement of \redt{2.5x}, and a peek speedup improvement of \redt{10x}.
Our evaluation further shows much time cost in initialization which limit the performance and scalability of \myds.
Therefore, our future work will reduce overhead of initialization as well as guarantee the performance and scalability of \myds.
%As to poor performance on iterative applications, our future work will provide scalable iterative processing.
